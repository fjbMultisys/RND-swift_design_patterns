# Data Structures & Algorithms

Swift is a popular programming language for developing iOS applications, and it provides a wide range of data structures and algorithms to work with. Here are some commonly used data structures and algorithms in Swift iOS, along with resources to learn more:

Arrays - Arrays are a common data structure in Swift that allows you to store a collection of values of the same type.
Resource:

Swift official documentation on Arrays: https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/CollectionTypes.html#ID114
Dictionaries - Dictionaries are another important data structure in Swift that allow you to store key-value pairs.

Sets - Sets are a collection of unique values in Swift, and they are useful for operations like finding the intersection or union of two sets.

Linked Lists - Linked lists are a data structure in Swift that allow you to store a sequence of elements where each element points to the next element in the sequence.

Trees - Trees are a hierarchical data structure in Swift that allow you to represent relationships between elements, such as parent-child relationships.

Sorting Algorithms - Sorting algorithms are used to arrange elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending order. Swift provides built-in functions for sorting arrays, and there are many sorting algorithms you can implement yourself.

Search Algorithms - Search algorithms are used to find a specific element in a data structure. Swift provides built-in functions for searching arrays, and there are many search algorithms you can implement yourself.
